# Learning Environment IoT Dataset

This repository contains a real-world multimodal IoT dataset collected from academic learning environments for environmental and acoustic analysis.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes synchronized measurements of environmental and acoustic parameters collected from three distinct learning contexts:
- Faculty Cabin
- Lecture Classroom (38 students)
- Practical Laboratory (33 students)

The recorded parameters include temperature, air quality, illuminance, and noise-related acoustic labels.
